========================================================================
This is the quick and dirty README for the jspdo code...

========================================================================
To build this code:

- Edit the top of the makefile, if necessary, to point it to your v8,
sqlite3, and/or mysql. The Makefile assumes that the v8::convert
headers live at ../../include/.

- run 'make'

- Run the demo with: ./shell test.js


========================================================================
To include this code into your own project you need to:


- Copy the following files:

  cpdo*.?pp
  jspdo.?pp
  jspdo-init.cpp (GENERATED: see below)

- Compile the following files:

  cpdo_amalgamation.cpp
  jspdo.cpp (this will #include jspdo-init.cpp)


- #include jspdo.hpp into your app.

- Run jspdo::SetupV8Bindings() from your v8-init routine, passing it
the global object for your v8 engine. It will install the class JSPDO
in that object.

Compilation/Linker arguments:

See the included Makefile for the full list of various linker arguments.
Here is an overview:

General compiler/linker flags:

    On Linux platforms, use -fPIC. Don't ask me why.
    -I/path/to/v8/convert/install/prefix

For v8:

    Linker: -L${V8_PREFIX} -lv8 (or -lv8_g)

For sqlite3:

    Normally nothing special is required.

For cpdo_amalgamation.cpp:

    Enable sqlite3 driver:

        -DCPDO_ENABLE_SQLITE3=1

    Enable MySQL driver:

        -DCPDO_ENABLE_MYSQL5=1
        Add the flags from (mysql_config --cflags)

For jspdo.cpp:

        -I/path/to/v8/convert/install/prefix
        -DCPDO_ENABLE_MYSQL5=1 and/or -DCPDO_ENABLE_SQLITE3=1

Linking:
     - If using MySQL add: (mysql_config --libs).
     - If using sqlite3 add: -lsqlite3 (or link in your own copy of
     sqlite3.o)

When using MySQL it is impossible (at least on Linux) to build a
static binary because MySQL links to libraries which cannot work in
statically-linked applications.



If neither sqlite3 nor MySQL are enabled then the library will be
useless - it will not be able to connect to anything.

========================================================================
jspdo-init.cpp:

This file is generated by doing the following:

~> cc -o js2c js2c.c
~> ./js2c jspdoInitCode < jspdo-init.js > jspdo-init.cpp

It is #included by jspdo.cpp and should not be compiled into its own
object file.
