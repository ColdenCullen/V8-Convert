========================================================================
This is the quick and dirty README for the jspdo code...

========================================================================
To build this code:

- Edit the top of the makefile, if necessary.

- run 'make'

- Run the demo with: ./shell test.js


========================================================================
To include this code into your own project you need to:


- Copy the following files:

  cpdo*.?pp
  jspdo.cpp
  jspdo-init.cpp (GENERATED: see below)

- Compile the following files:

  cpdo_amalgamation.cpp
  jspdo.cpp (this will #include jspdo-init.cpp)


See the included Makefile for the various linker arguments.

- #include jspdo.hpp into your app.

- Run jspdo::SetupV8Bindings() from your v8-init routine, passing it
the global object for your v8 engine. It will install the class JSPDO
in that object.


========================================================================
jspdo-init.cpp:

This file is generated by doing the following:


-----
cc -o js2c js2c.c
./js2c jspdoInitCode < jspdo-init.js > jspdo-init.cpp
-----

It is #included by jspdo.cpp and should not be compiled into its own
object file.
